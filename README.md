Module 2 Challenge -- Stock Loops

With this code, we are using VBA to sort raw stock data to compile and summarize
stock information.  Specifically, we are summarizing all data per Stock symbol
to find the yearly change in price, the percentage change, and the total volume
of stock traded over the course of the year.  We have also added a section to 
pinpoint which stocks had the greatest positive percentage increase, greatest
negative percentage decrease, and greatest total volume traded over the course
of the year.  The data is separated onto three different worksheets by year, 
and our script is designed to run across all sheets in our workbook.  

Code used in this script was created with knowledge and processes learned from
in-class activities, and some code is directly sourced from previous classroom 
activities.
